Agricultural systems and their products are essential components to the pacific northwestern (PNW) region of the United States (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington).  In 2014, the U.S. agricultural sector created a gross output of more than 835 billion dollars with an employee base of approximately 750,000 people.  With roughly 2 million farms in the US, with an average size of about 435 acres, total grain production alone was $436 million (USDA Economic Research Service, 2014).  For the state of Washington in 2017, agriculture production value exceeded $9 billion, with over 160,000 jobs, making up 13 percent of the state’s economy. Comparatively, the Washington forestry support industries generated over $1.8 billion in total economic revenue across the same time frame (Sandison, 2017).  Idaho and Oregon additionally have extensive agricultural systems; Idaho produced over 180 different commodities across over 27,000 farms using over 11 million acres of farmland in 2017 (with potatoes accounting for 30% of the US potato production) (National Agricultural Statistics Service, October 2015), while Oregon similarly depends upon agriculture for its economic growth, with over 40,000 farms, producing over 8 billion annually (Sorte and Rahe 2015).  Overall, the PNW region is a critical part of the United States economic and agricultural systems output, supporting human and natural systems health, food security, and labor markets (Yorgey and Kruger, 2017).

Given the considerable economic complexity of agricultural commodity systems, as well as the potential negative implications due to unforeseen events, agricultural crop insurance has been an important component for mitigating risk (Christiansen, et al, 1975, Diskin, 1997). The United States efforts to provide a level of insurance protection for agriculture was initiated in 1938, with the development of the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC).  The FCIC was formed as a means to underwrite insurance policies that were provided by private crop insurance corporations, in order to help farmers recover from the effects of the Great Depression (National Crop Insurance Services, 2014). The FCIC efforts were initially an informal and little used mechanism until the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980 (FCIA), which expanded crop insurance programs to many more crops and regions of the country, encouraged expansion to replace free disaster coverage, and authorized a subsidy equal to 30 percent of the crop insurance premium, limited to the dollar amount at 65 percent coverage.  In 1994, a newly revised Crop Insurance Reform Act made participation in the crop insurance program mandatory, in order for farmers to be eligible for deficiency payments under price support programs, certain loans, and other benefits.   This resulted in a considerable number of farmers participating: an evaluation of insurance acreage in 1998 determined that over 180 million acres were insured, a three-fold increase as compared to 1988.  

Beginning in 1996, the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) formed their Risk Management Agency (RMA), which worked to increase the availability and effectiveness of federal crop insurance as a risk management tool (http://usda.gov/rma). With the implementation of the FCIA and the RMA, program improvements (i.e. providing direct payments to farmer, implementing subsidies) grew the level of program participation to over 90% of all US farmed land (Table 1). The results of these crop insurance program efforts have had a dramatic impact on overall United States farm management, including the reduction of income risk around crop production, increasing land values, increasing farm survivability rates, stabilization of cash flow, and liquidity improvement (Yu et al, 2018). In addition, the availability of agricultural insurance has also changed farm investment across crops in developed and developing countries, and, as such, can facilitate capital accumulation and economic growth.  By 2015, the USDA had insured over 282 million acres of farmland, with an insurance liability net worth of $102 billion dollars (USDA Risk Management Agency, 2015).

As part of the crop insurance process, corporate authorized insurance providers (AIPs) work with the USDA’s Farm Services Agency (FSA) to quantify commodity value, and to engage in insurance contracts with farmers, which are underwritten by the FCIC. This data is then provided to the RMA, which publishes all crop insurance claims going back to 1989 (http://rma.usda.gov), organized at monthly intervals and at a county level spatial scale for the entire United States. Each insurance record represents a claim filed by a farmer, containing the dollar amount of the insured loss, the commodity type related to the loss (e.g. wheat, barley, canola), the acreage for the loss, and most notably, a cause for the crop damage (e.g. heat, drought, hail, decline in price, failure of irrigation supply) (Table 2).  The extent of this data archive is staggering: for example, from 1989 to 2015, the USDA’s crop insurance data collection for the Pacific Northwest (Idaho, Oregon, and Washington) contains over 2.8 million claims, encompassing over 35 different commodities across 30 different damage causes (Table 3).

##### Climate Impacts and the Mitigation of Risk

The interactions of climate and economics can have direct impacts on food security and resilience, and thus, effecting agricultural risk (Barrett et al, 2010, Gundersen et al, 2011).  Under varying climatic conditions, agricultural cropping systems can be quite dynamic, with complex physical, social and economic relationships combining to have unexpected outcomes.  Such outcomes raise questions about the extent to which climate can effect long term agricultural production, including land values and crop yield. Previous studies have used county specific yield and weather in a panel methodology to examine nonlinear interactions between temperature and precipitation on crop yields (Lobell and Burke, 2010). Schlenker and Roberts (2009) project that warmer temperatures can severely reduce crop yields in the rainfed United States by 30 to 82 percent depending on the speed of global warming by the end of the century, while Deschenes and Greenstone (2007) and Kucharik and Serbin (2008) both found that projected precipitation increases will be beneficial for corn and soybean yields.  Conversely, McCarl, Villavicencio, and Wu (2008) indicate that increased precipitation can actually be harmful for wheat yields.  Given the specific commodity and geographic location, climate can have a multitude of impacts that variably effect agricultural outputs.
Drought in particular plays an important role in the success or failure of agricultural systems, which is reflected in agricultural insurance losses nationwide. For example, United States drought conditions in 2015 resulted in large nationwide insurance losses for wheat (~$384 million dollars), with the Inland Pacific Northwest making up $84 million dollars of that total (Figure 1).  These conditions can force farmers to consider additional risk management approaches that complement insurance mechanisms, such as irrigation, selective crop abandonment, and unique crop rotation practices, which may mitigate current and future losses and preserve long-term economic viability of cropping systems (Wallander et al, 2013).  For example, crop producers who utilize conservation tillage are often able to improve the capture and storage of soil moisture, which provides their crops an important buffer against drought impacts. Crop diversification, another drought mitigation approach, is already being applied in the PNW region: between 2007 and 2015, there was reportedly very slight growth in terms of the total number of crop acres in Washington (attributed to drought impact), yet there was substantial growth in the wine and viticulture industry, with more than 50,000 acres of production in 2015 (Sandison, 2015).  From an adaptive perspective, economic implications of more severe drought conditions into the future have encouraged farmers to consider alternative crop systems that may be more economically viable, such as niche fruit commodities.  For example, Washington leads the nation in several of these systems, including apples, pears, and hops, which are quite profitable, given their price to acreage ratios, as well as high consumer demand (McLain and Castro, 2015).  More recently, the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) made a preliminary assessment of the impacts of the 2015 drought on farms, with overall estimated losses of at least $366 million dollars, that included losses in many commodities, such as wheat, apples, blueberries, and raspberries.  Washington apple losses in 2015 due to drought or extreme heat reduced production by roughly 280 million pounds. These lower yields, based on 2014 prices, represented a potential loss of $86.52 million dollars, from an overall $1.9 billion revenue (Capital Press, 2016), primarily due to water shortages that effected irrigation capabilities. In 2014, over 40 percent of Oregon farms relied on some form of irrigation, while in 2015, two-thirds of all Oregon counties received a drought declaration (Oregon Water Resources Department, 2015).  Similar to efforts in Washington, farmers in Oregon and Idaho have been forced to re-evaluate approaches to long term cropping management, taking into consideration the risks imposed by potential drought conditions that may result in substantial financial losses.  

Given the above, the consensus amongst a wide spectrum of research indicates several issues:  1) there are considerable economic implications that make crop insurance a useful tool in mitigating agricultural risk; 2) climate conditions play an important role in the varying aspects of agricultural production; 3) the combined efforts of insurance protection as well as climate risk mitigation agricultural practices give farmers a level of protection against unforeseen natural systems and economic events, and 4) the USDA’s historical archive of agricultural insurance claim data provides an excellent source to examine the variability of agricultural risk as it relates to specific commodities, climatic and non-climatic damage causes, as well as geography and time.

##### Initial Crop Insurance Exploratory Data Analysis across the Pacific Northwest

In terms of crop insurance loss across the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, and Idaho), there are three key agricultural regions where the majority of insurance claims occur: the Inland Pacific Northwest (IPNW), which is a dryland dominated (e.g. minimal irrigation) regime with a focus on wheat, barley, and sweet peas; the southern Idaho Snake river valley, which is a predominantly irrigated area, with large production systems in potatoes, wheat, and barley; and the eastern Oregon Willamette valley, which has a commodity focus of hay, wheat, onions, and pears (Figure 2).  These three regions make up over 95% of all agricultural production for the three-state area (Yorgey et al, 2017).  Across this region, wheat is one of the dominant commodities that incurs loss, with claims filed totaling approximately 20,600, with a loss of $1.56 billion dollars from 1989-2015. For Washington alone for this same time period, over 8500 claims for wheat were filed, totaling 676 million dollars in losses, across 35 differing damage causes (Table 3). Economic demands also play a role in the diversity of wheat financial losses spatially as well as compared to other commodities: for example, for wheat claims alone, Oregon had approximately $116,000/per claim for roughly 4,000 claims during the same time period.  In comparison, Oregon barley claims for the same time period number 933 records for $14 million in losses ($15,005/per claim).  In comparison, Washington had approximately $98,000/per claim for the 8500 wheat claims for the same time period, and Idaho had $46,500/per claim for 1700 claims. 

For all three states from 1989-2015, drought effects on wheat were the largest component of insurance loss; for Idaho, wheat claims from 1989-2015 due to drought totaled approximately $90 million dollars, which is roughly 25% of all Idaho wheat claims during that time period. Similarly, in Washington, drought related claims totaled approximately $350 million dollars, accounting for almost half of all Washington insurance claims.  Overall, drought and heat related events in Pacific Northwest have a substantial effect on the outcome of agricultural commodity systems. Commodity loss ($) and claim frequency across the three-state region provides differing patterns based on crop type and damage cause. For example, northeastern Oregon wheat loss claims attributed to drought peaked in 2001 and were fairly minimal during high drought time periods in 2009 and 2015, while both Idaho and Washington had large spikes in wheat claim loss due to drought for 2009 and 2015. Barley claims indicated a similar signal for all three states, with loss and claim count peaks occurring in 2015.  As a whole, differing commodities provide unique spatial and temporal patterns of insurance loss, given unique aspects of crop phenology, revenue loss and claim frequency.

Climatically, drought and heat were the dominant causes of overall insurance loss, totaling slightly over 187 million dollars (Figure 3). The overall frequency of claims by commodity type and damage cause followed somewhat different patterns, with wheat having the overall highest average annual commodity claim count, with drought, excessive moisture, and cold winters being the top reasons for total commodity claim filings (Figure 4).  This differentiation between loss ($) and claim frequency is an important distinction, given the potential for very large, individual claims to have a greater effect on damage cause totals, vs. many smaller individual claims.

##### Refinement of study area, time frame, and commodity type

Of the three farming regions described above, our study area for this analysis was limited to the highly productive IPNW region of eastern Washington, northern Oregon, and western Idaho, which is dominated by claims filed for wheat, apples, cherries, dry peas, and barley (Figure 5).  With over 2.8 million USDA crop insurance claims filed between 2001-2015 for this area alone, crop losses were 72% of the total amount of claims for the three-state region overall.  Given the spatial diversity in terms of cropping systems across all three states, the IPNW area provides a more homogenous, well distributed region to allow us to explore spatial and temporal variations, while maintaining a fairly consistent county level claim total across the region as a whole.  Additionally, by narrowing our region to only the IPNW, we eliminated counties where little or no insurance claims were filed, primarily due to landscape, urbanization, or profitability constraints.  
The time frame for this data analysis was also narrowed to 2001 to 2015, given that over 83% of all insurance claims from 1989 to 2015 occurred within this 15-year time window. Within this time frame, wheat was the predominant commodity incurring insurance loss for our IPNW study area, with over 250 million dollars in claims, with apples coming in a distant second, at 52 million dollars (Figure 6). As expected, the cause of damage varying widely, depending upon the commodity type.  For example, wheat insurance loss for the indicated time period was due primarily to drought and heat (Figure 7), while apple insurance loss was mainly attributed to hail, frost, and freeze (Figure 8).  Similarly, there were considerable variations annually for both wheat and apples. Beginning in 2008, claim loss values as well as the frequency of claims increased substantially, with large increases in 2009 and 2015.  Our modeling efforts, described later in our research objectives and methodology, quantitatively explore these variations both in time as well as by damage cause.

##### Research Objective: Examining Variability of Crop Insurance Loss for the IPNW

After exploring the range and variability of the USDA agricultural crop insurance dataset, which includes individual claim loss by commodity and damage cause, our exploratory data analysis efforts resulted in a narrowing of our study region and time frame to the 26-county region of the IPNW, from 2001 to 2015 (Figure 2).  Our research objective for this refined area and time period was to quantitatively explore how the crop insurance loss varies by damage cause (drought, heat, cold winter, hail, etc.), and time (annually), focusing on two high production commodities with differing climate relationships (wheat and apples).  How do crop insurance loss claims for these two productive commodity systems vary temporally, and by climate associated damage cause?  From this analysis, a larger research question is as follows: do the commodity specific temporal and damage cause patterns seen in agricultural insurance loss align with the historical patterns of climate variation seen in the IPNW from 2001 to 2015?  Can insurance loss provide an effective barometer to gauge the changes in climate on agricultural system production? To address these questions, we examined insurance claims for each of the aforementioned commodities individually by constructing a zero inflated two-step mixed modeling approach for each of the commodities in question, from 2001to 2015.

##### Methodology and Model Design

As noted previously, insurance crop loss records were acquired from the USDA’s risk management office (http://rma.usda.gov), which organizes and updates insurance claims at monthly intervals and at a county level spatial scale.  Each USDA record represents a claim filed by a farm organization, containing the dollar amount of the loss, the commodity type related to the loss (wheat, barley, canola, etc.), a cause for the crop damage (heat, drought, hail, decline in price, failure of irrigation supply, etc.), the acreage for the loss, as well as the county, month, year. Insurance claim records were aggregated by county and year, to provide a summarized view of the data, for factor comparisons.  Methodologically, we performed three steps in our data analysis (Figure 9). First, we performed a comparative regional analysis of all commodities and damage causes from 1989-2015 across the three-state area of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington, narrowing our scope of focus to a region and time period that were the most agriculturally productive, as well as fairly consistent spatially in terms of farm output.  The results of this process identified the 26 county farming region of the inland Pacific Northwest,  divided between western Washington, eastern Idaho, and the northwestern portions of Oregon, from 2001-2015, as the most productive in terms of yields and insurance loss for the tri-state area.   With over 2.8 million USDA crop insurance claims filed between 2001-2015 for this area alone, crop losses were 72% of the total amount of claims for three state study area overall.  Given the spatial diversity in terms of cropping systems across all three states, the IPNW area provides a more homogenous, well distributed region to allow us to explore spatial and temporal variations, while maintaining a fairly consistent county level claim total across the region as a whole.  
After narrowing our study area and temporal extent, our second step was address issues of missing data and zero inflation. Zero inflation represents data where there are excessive zero or zero-bound values, which may skew or make normalization difficult (Lambert, 1992).  In this particular instance, there may be situations where zero insurance claims are filed for select years/commodities/damage causes, when, in fact, a particular commodity is actually being grown.  Elimination of these records would not be prudent, given that they do not represent missing data, but are actual zero claim records that indicate no insurance loss for a commodity system. Comparatively, there are other instances where there is actual missing data for a county, year, or damage cause, which represents zero insurance claims in years/counties where a certain commodity was not grown at all.  These sets of missing data are best removed from our analysis dimension space, in order to improve normalization. To address these issues of missing data, we performed commodity and damage cause subsetting, to reduce our dataset to only those commodities and damage causes that have actual values across the spatial and temporal extent.  This process resulted in reducing our analysis to two key commodity types (wheat and apples), as well nine key damage causes (drought, heat, hail, frost, excessive precipitation, freeze, cold winter, cold wet weather, and decline in price), for only those counties where the commodity in question had crop yield results from 2001-2015, as indicated by USDA crop yield summaries (NASS Crop Yield Annual Summaries 2001-2015).
Our third and final step was to address the issue of zero inflated data, thru the use of a two-step or zero inflated gamma hurdle model, using a generalized linear mixed modeling structure (Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002).  Hurdle models can be described as two specific models that are 1) used in combination to help identify zero or nonzero values, and then 2) model the outputs of the non-zeros. For this analysis, we used a first step logistic regression model with a binary dependent variable of zero or non-zero, to determine the probability of a particular county/year/damage cause of having zero insurance claims or not.
The non-zero results of the first step logistic regression model were then used in a second step generalized linear mixed modeling analysis.  Generalized linear mixed modeling is a statistical modeling approach where the linear predictor contains both fixed and random effects (Demidenko, 2004) and are particularly valuable in situations where repeated measurements exist on a common statistical unit. Fixed effects factors have levels that are of primary interest and would be used again if the experiment were repeated, while random effects have levels that are not of primary interest, but rather are thought of as a random selection from a much larger set of levels (Seltman, 2018). A common advantage of mixed modeling approaches are that they can accommodate issues of missing values, versus a more classical analysis of variance (ANOVA) approach, which requires no missing values (Vargas et al 2015).  A generalized linear mixed model (McLean, Sanders, Stroop 1991) can be described using the following formula:

<center>Y = XB  +Zu + e</center>
<center>Where:  Y is a known vector of observations</center>
<center>B is an unknown vector of fixed effects</center>
<center>u is an unknown vector of random effects</center>
<center>e is an unknown vector of random errors
<center>X and B are known design matrices relating observations Y to B and u</center>

For this particular data analysis, our generalized linear mixed model matrix notation can be described as follows:

<center>Insurance loss ($) = year + damage cause + (1 | county)</center>
<center>Where: summarized annual insurance loss ($) is the dependent variable</center>
<center>year and damage cause are fixed effects independent variables</center>
<center>county is an independent random effects variable</center>

In order to produce a normal distribution, we transformed our insurance loss dependent variable using a log base 10 function.
